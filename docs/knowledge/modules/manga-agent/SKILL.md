# Manga Agent Skill

Use this skill for changes under the Manga Agent workflow. Read `flow.md` when you need event ordering, run status transitions, API contract details, or tool behavior beyond the summary below.

## Domain Model

The Manga Agent is a chapter-scoped assistant with conversation-level isolation. A chapter can have multiple Manga Agent conversations; each conversation owns its messages, runs, AgentScope session, and conversation workspace.

The selected workspace chapter is authoritative. Do not silently switch chapters based on free-text user intent. The agent should ask the user to switch the workspace if another chapter is intended.

Image generation is not performed by the Manga Agent. The agent prepares or refines storyboard scenes, then tells the user to use the existing Generate Manga action.

## Core Flow

The controller resolves the current user and delegates to `MangaAgentService`. Synchronous calls return a final reply. Stream calls return an `SseEmitter` and run on `mangaGenerationExecutor`.

For a new run, `MangaAgentService` resolves the active `MangaAgentConversation` unless a conversation id is supplied, opens the per-run tool tracking scope, and delegates workflow execution to `MangaWorkflowOrchestrator`. The orchestrator validates the message, builds a workflow context snapshot, checks idempotency through `GenerationGuardService.executeMangaAgentRun`, and dispatches to a `MangaWorkflowNodeHandler` through `MangaWorkflowNodeRegistry`.

`MangaDirectorAgentNode` is the first concrete node. It saves the user message, builds agent messages from the selected conversation history, syncs chapter knowledge to the AgentScope workspace, builds an `AgentRunRequest`, invokes AgentScope through the gateway, maps streamed events, and saves the final assistant or degraded reply. Non-Director routes currently fall back to the Director handler until dedicated Storyboard, Review, HITL, and generation nodes are added.

For resume, the service requires an existing `WAITING_USER` run, reconstructs a continuation message from the stored user-input request and the user's answer, clears waiting state, and continues the same request id.

`AgentScopeAgentFactory` creates or reuses a per-user/story/chapter/conversation/task/model/workspace agent. `AgentScopeRuntimeContextFactory` passes per-call business values through AgentScope v2 `RuntimeContext` as `MangaAgentRuntimeContext`. For `AgentTaskType.MANGA_DIRECTOR`, `MangaAgentToolkitFactory` registers the Manga tools into AgentScope tool groups.

The frontend consumes AG-UI as the default live protocol. `POST /conversations/{conversationId}/ag-ui/run` and `POST /conversations/{conversationId}/ag-ui/runs/{requestId}/resume` are the preferred endpoints. Legacy chapter-level endpoints auto-resolve the active conversation and remain compatibility paths. Keep the execution panel as the single place that explains what the agent is doing; do not add a second competing progress widget.

In the main app navigation, `首页` is the Manga Agent conversation surface. `工作区` is the story/project management surface where users create, import, select, and edit stories. Do not point `workspace` back to `home`; that recreates a navigation loop and hides the agent from the first screen.

## Tools

Manga Director tools are grouped through AgentScope `Toolkit`:

- `context-tools`: read-only chapter/story/storyboard/image context.
- `storyboard-tools`: storyboard generation and storyboard persistence.
- `hitl-tools`: user question/confirmation flow.

- `get_chapter_context`: read-only; returns story, chapter, source excerpt, storyboard scenes, and generated image status.
- `generate_storyboard`: mutating; generates scenes through `SceneService.generateScenes` and saves them through the existing scene flow.
- `save_storyboard`: mutating; saves a complete list of storyboard scenes.
- `save_structured_storyboard`: mutating; normalizes page/panel objects through `StructuredStoryboardService` before saving scenes. Prefer this for creating or rewriting storyboard pages.
- `ask_user`: read-only at the tool level but pauses the run by storing `AgentUserInputRequest` and throwing `ToolSuspendException`.

After a mutating tool succeeds, failures in the final agent response may degrade rather than fail the whole user action. Preserve this behavior unless deliberately changing recovery semantics.

## Invariants

- `requestId` is the idempotency and resume key. Preserve it across stream retries and resume calls.
- `conversationId` isolates messages, runs, AgentScope session id, and conversation workspace. Starting a new conversation must not reuse the old AgentScope session.
- Only `RUNNING` and `WAITING_USER` are open statuses. Terminal statuses are `SUCCEEDED`, `DEGRADED`, `FAILED`, `CANCELLED`, and `INTERRUPTED`. `CANCELLED` is user initiated through `/runs/{requestId}/cancel`; `INTERRUPTED` is system repair for stale `RUNNING` runs.
- Persist non-`text_delta` run events so the frontend can restore an interrupted stream.
- Frontend run progress should be derived from persisted/streamed events, not from hard-coded timers or generic "running" text alone.
- AG-UI events are the live observability protocol. Legacy events remain compatibility payloads and persisted restore input.
- Chapter source text lives in `chapters.novel_content`; chat-derived fallback comes from `Chapter.novelContentOrJoinedMessages()`. `AgentWorkspaceSyncService` writes this into the story workspace `KNOWLEDGE.md` before a Manga Director run.
- Manga Director must not use AgentScope shell/filesystem tools to find business content. `AgentScopeHarnessAgentGateway` disables Harness shell/filesystem tools for this business agent; chapter/story facts must come from `get_chapter_context`, synced `KNOWLEDGE.md`, and registered ArtVerse tools.
- Manga Director tools should read user, chapter, conversation, request id, and Coze key from `MangaAgentRuntimeContext` injected through `RuntimeContext`. Avoid adding new factory-captured per-run fields.
- When backend emits AG-UI frames, `MangaAgentPage.tsx` must translate `ag_ui_event` frames into execution panel state and synchronize final persisted messages after `RUN_FINISHED`; otherwise the frontend can appear stuck or require a manual refresh.
- Use `ask_user` for blocking decisions instead of plain-text questions.
- Keep controllers thin. Put public entrypoint behavior in `MangaAgentService` and workflow execution behavior in `MangaWorkflowOrchestrator`.
- Keep AgentScope execution inside workflow nodes. `MangaWorkflowOrchestrator` should own routing, guard/run lifecycle, and workflow-level status events, not direct AgentScope request construction.
- Do not expose internal Guard endpoints from user-facing navigation.

## Change Checklist

- If API payloads, AG-UI mappings, or SSE event names change, update `MangaAgentDtos`, `AgUiEventFactory`, `frontend/src/api.ts`, and the execution panel in `MangaAgentPage.tsx` together.
- If tool return shapes change, update frontend timeline handling and tests around `AgentRunToolStatus`.
- If run status transitions change, update `MangaAgentRunService` tests and open-run restore behavior.
- If cancellation or stale-run repair changes, update backend status tests, frontend terminal-state rendering, and the flow reference.
- If prompt or workspace knowledge changes, check both `MangaAgentConversationService.buildSystemPrompt` and `AgentWorkspaceSyncService.buildKnowledge`.
- If AgentScope session/cache key inputs change, update `AgentScopeHarnessAgentGatewayTest`, `MangaAgentToolkitFactoryTest`, and `AgentSessionIdFactoryTest`.
- If `MangaAgentRuntimeContext` changes, update `AgentScopeHarnessAgentGatewayTest`, `MangaAgentToolFactoryTest`, and the v2 refactor plan.
- If conversation isolation changes, update `MangaAgentConversationRegistry`, message/run repositories, frontend conversation API helpers, and this skill.
- If this skill disagrees with code, trust code first and update this skill or `flow.md`.

## Validation

For backend-only changes, run from `ArtVerse/`:

```bash
mvn -q -DskipTests compile
